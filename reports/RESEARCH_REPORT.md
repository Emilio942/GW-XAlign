*Autonomous research cycle — October 13, 2026 (complete)*

## 1. Executive summary

Thirteen experiment suites (A–L) were run to test the GW-XAlign research program end-to-end: a GPU-accelerated EGW solver stack (POT + PyTorch/CUDA), synthetic metric-measure spaces with ground-truth correspondences, and nine real neural networks (MNIST: MLP-128/MLP-16/CNN-64, multiple seeds; CIFAR-10: ViT-S, MLP-Mixer-S, CNN, multiple seeds).

| # | Question | Result |
|---|---|---|
| A | Concentration of empirical EGW (Cycle 1) | **N^-1/2 confirmed** (α = −0.47…−0.62); ε^-1/2 factor **not present**; bias decreases with ε |
| B | Coupling stability ‖Δγ*‖ ≤ C(δ/ε) | Linear in δ confirmed; **slope ε-independent** (exponent ≈ 0.0) — qualitative stability yes, 1/ε-law no |
| C/K | Spectral pre-screen (RQ2) | **Confirmed and calibrated**: N-normalized spectral L1 separates healthy vs unrelated/fragmented with **AUC 0.98–1.00**; but it is a *necessary*, not *sufficient* predictor of fine-grained alignability (ρ≈0.35 within aligned family) |
| D | Barycentric map stability (Cycles 8/9) | **Confirmed**: sup-change ≈ 0.9 × coupling perturbation (1.3 at ε=0.005) |
| E | GW ↔ downstream loss (primary bound) | **MNIST: ρ = −0.85…−0.96** (50 configs, 8 pairs). **CIFAR: ρ = −0.64 with a genuine counterexample** (ViT→Mixer) — see §8 |
| F/G | MoE fragmentation (RQ1) + repair | ε **cannot** rescue fragmentation and destroys fine structure at large ε. Repair must fix D1: unsupervised **ordinal-preserving de-offset recovers 96–100%** of clean alignment (affine corruption model) |
| H | Debiased EGW as predictor | **No gain** (identical ρ on MNIST and CIFAR) |
| I | Identifiability law (SNR/density collapse) | **Refuted in both forms**; instance hardness (warp draw) dominates — noise and density effects are mild. Important self-correction of an earlier claim |
| J | Deleted-edge fragmentation | **No repair from D1 alone works** (de-offset, MDS-imputation all fail) — fundamental obstruction requiring anchors |
| L | External validity (ViT/Mixer/CNN on CIFAR-10) | Zero-shot cross-family transfer works (ViT→CNN reaches **85% of ceiling**); the GW↔loss law **attenuates** (−0.64) and admits violations when the target feature space is intrinsically weakly class-structured |

**Headline findings**

1. **The GW↔loss law holds within architecture families and attenuates across families.** On MNIST (MLP/CNN, 8 pairs × 5 ε): ρ(GW, 1−accuracy) up to −0.96. On CIFAR (ViT/Mixer/CNN): −0.64 overall, with a structurally explained violation: ViT→Mixer has *lower* GW than ViT→CNN (0.0096 vs 0.109) yet chance-level transfer (0.19 vs 0.62). GW measures geometric cloud similarity; transfer additionally requires class coherence of the target space (Mixer self-kNN only 0.59). *Practical rule: the GW statistic must be read against the target's self-kNN ceiling.*
2. **Zero-shot alignment is real and strong within families**: ViT→ViT(seed 2) recovers 97% of the kNN ceiling on CIFAR; MLP128→MLP128(seed 2) 0.92/0.97 on MNIST; CNN→CNN(seed 2) 0.91/0.93 on MNIST.
3. **Cross-family transfer can be excellent** where the target space is class-coherent: ViT→CNN reaches 0.63 = 85% of ceiling, and the *dimensionality* mismatch 128→16 costs little on MNIST (0.61/0.93). The bottleneck is the *source's* intrinsic geometric detail, not ambient dimension (MLP16→CNN64 is the only failing MNIST pair).
4. **Fragmentation is repairable iff the corruption preserves ordinal structure**: de-offset repairs affine inflation (96–100%); deleted-edge corruption is information-theoretically unrepairable from D1 alone (§7.2).
5. **A theory-relevant correction**: correspondence quality under GW is dominated by *instance hardness* (the random warp draw), robust to noise (σ up to SNR 0.25 on a good instance) and to sampling density (no collapse at fixed instance, N=200→800). Any error bound must therefore be stated at the measure level and must include an instance-conditioning term — per-point bounds are unattainable.

## 3. Exp A — Concentration of the empirical EGW divergence

Population anchor N_ref = 2000; fresh i.i.d. pairs per rep; N ∈ {100,…,800}; ε ∈ {0.01, 0.03, 0.1}.

| ε | slope α in N (theory −0.5) | bias \|EGW_ε − GW\| |
|-----|-----|-----|
| 0.01 | −0.62 | 0.0041 |
| 0.03 | −0.53 | 0.0048 |
| 0.10 | −0.47 | 0.0054 |

Verdict on Cycle 1: the N^−1/2 rate is real; the ε^−1/2 variance amplification is absent in this regime (measured ε-exponent ≈ 0), so the proposed bound's constant is mis-specified but its order in N is correct.

## 4. Exp B/D — Stability

- Coupling: ‖Δγ*‖ linear in metric perturbation δ; Lipschitz slopes 0.25 / 0.35 / 0.24 at ε = 0.005/0.02/0.05 (ε-exponent +0.002). Small, controlled, essentially ε-independent.
- Barycentric map: linear in coupling perturbation; slopes 1.32 / 0.89 / 0.90. Mildly worse at small ε, no instability.
- Both support robust zero-shot deployment under drift/noise; both *refute* the specific 1/ε constants proposed in the formal-verification cycles.

## 5. Exp C + K — Spectral pre-screen (RQ2)

Exp C (single N) suggested a threshold; Exp K calibrated it properly across N ∈ {250, 400} and four families using the **N-normalized** statistic sd_mean = N⁻¹ Σᵢ|λᵢ(D1)−λᵢ(D2)|:

| family | sd_mean (min / median / max) |
|---|---|
| isometric (healthy) | 0 / 0 / 0 |
| aligned (healthy) | 0.111 / 0.158 / 0.285 |
| unrelated | 0.230 / 0.289 / 0.316 |
| fragmented (gap>0) | 0.261 / 0.433 / 0.963 |

**AUC(healthy vs unrelated) = 0.98; AUC(healthy vs fragmented) ≈ 1.00; AUC(clean vs fragmented) = 1.00.**

Answers to RQ2: the eigenspectrum distance *is* a valid, gradient-free, N-robust pre-screen for gross misalignment (AUC ≈ 1), with isometry detection exact (0.000). It is not a fine-grained predictor of correspondence quality within the healthy family (ρ ≈ 0.35 with 1−prec@10; the EGW objective value itself does better at ρ ≈ 0.63). Use it for triage, not for scoring.

## 6. Exp A-note — correspondence metrics

Neighborhood precision (prec@k) rather than exact bijection accuracy is the right alignment metric: exact matching is ill-posed under local near-degeneracies even for humans; prec@10 tracks class-transfer behavior directly.

## 7. Exp F/G/J — MoE fragmentation (RQ1)

### 7.1 ε does not rescue (Exp F)

Clean prec@10 ≈ 0.44; at fragmentation gap=0.3 → 0.15; gap=0.6 → 0.05; gap=1 → 0.03. Increasing ε from 0.01 to 0.3 recovers at most +0.04 and *destroys fine structure on clean data* (prec@1: 0.146 → 0.067). The quadratic GW loss treats pseudo-distances as geometry — smoothing cannot remove them.

### 7.2 Repairability depends on the corruption model (Exp G/G2/J)

- **Affine inflation** of inter-expert distances (ordinal-preserving): value-level repairs (clip / median-impute) make things *worse* (destroy ordinality); the unsupervised **de-offset** (subtract the intra/inter quantile gap) recovers **96–100%** of clean performance on well-conditioned instances and ≥ clean on others.
- **Deleted edges** (inter-expert entries = uninformative noise; ordinality destroyed): *nothing* works — none/de-offset/MDS-imputation all stay at rel = 0.0–0.5 of baseline, mostly ≤ 0.1. The inter-expert geometry is genuinely gone.

**Answer to RQ1:** routing fragmentation alters D1's spectrum dramatically (spectral shift 0→341) and is a true obstruction; entropic smoothing is the wrong tool; ordinal-preserving repair works exactly when the artifact preserves ordinal information; beyond that, anchors (labeled correspondences, cross-model information) are required.

## 8. Exp E/L — End-to-end zero-shot alignment (the error-bound law)

### MNIST (MLP128, MLP16, CNN64; 8 pairs × 5 ε = 50 configs)

| pair | dims | best acc_align | best acc_oos | (ceiling) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| MLP128→MLP128_s1 | 128→128 | 0.921 | 0.778 | 0.968 |
| CNN64→CNN64_s1 | 64→64 | 0.943 | 0.910 | 0.93* |
| MLP128→MLP16 | 128→16 | 0.671 | 0.616 | 0.927 |
| MLP128→CNN64 | 128→64 | 0.613 | 0.524 | 0.927 |
| MLP16→CNN64 | 16→64 | 0.291 | 0.328 | 0.93* |

ρ(GW, acc_align) = **−0.96** (initial 25 configs) / **−0.85** (50 configs incl. harder new pairs); ρ(EGW, acc_oos) = −0.89.

### CIFAR-10 (ViT-S ≈73% test acc, Mixer-S ≈60%, CNN ≈80%)

| pair | best acc_align | acc/ceiling | GW |
|---|---|---|---|
| ViT→ViT_s1 | 0.677 | 0.99 | 0.0034 |
| CNN→CNN_s1 | 0.712 | 0.94 | 0.0025 |
| ViT→CNN | 0.626 | 0.85 | 0.109 |
| ViT→Mixer | 0.191 | 0.32 | **0.0096** |
| Mixer→CNN | 0.212 | 0.36 | 0.069 |

ρ(GW, acc) = **−0.64** overall; ceiling-normalized −0.49.

**The law and its boundary.** Within families, GW orders transfer quality perfectly and alignment is near-ceiling. Across families the law attenuates and ViT→Mixer is a structural counterexample: low GW (geometrically similar clouds) but chance-level transfer, because the Mixer's mean-pooled feature space is intrinsically weakly class-structured (self-kNN 0.59). The error bound of the primary statement is empirically valid **conditional on target class-coherence**; a calibrated predictor should use `GW(μ1,μ2)` together with the target's self-kNN ceiling (or replace accuracy by acc/ceiling).

Other observations: ε is nearly free on clean real data (accuracy varies < 0.05 over ε ∈ [0.002, 0.05]) but matters for hard pairs (Mixer→CNN improves monotonically 0.11→0.21 with ε); the KDE out-of-sample pushforward (adaptive bandwidth) is reliable for in-distribution activations but does not extrapolate to off-manifold queries (class centroids).

## 9. Exp H/H2 — Debiased EGW

`EGW(A,B) − ½EGW(A,A) − ½EGW(B,B)` changes ρ by **0.000** on MNIST (−0.879 → −0.879) and CIFAR (−0.523 → −0.523). The self-terms are pair-independent in this regime. Debiasing is unnecessary for prediction here (it may still matter for *hypothesis testing* of exact alignment).

## 10. Exp I/I2/I3 — Identifiability: corrected findings

- **No SNR collapse law**: within-instance noise sweeps (σ up to 0.4·mean, SNR up to 0.27) leave prec@10 nearly flat (instance 2: 0.96 → 0.63 at extreme noise; instances 0/1 flat at their level).
- **No density collapse**: at fixed warp instance, N = 200 → 800 does not degrade precision (it improves: 0.09 → 0.23 mean; instance 2 reaches 0.61).
- **Instance hardness dominates**: the same σ and N give prec@10 anywhere in [0.02, 0.99] depending on the random warp draw. An earlier claim of a density-driven collapse in this report's draft was a **seed-instance confound** and is retracted.

**Consequence for theory:** bounds must be instance-conditioned (a functional of the warp, e.g., the best achievable correspondence distortion), stated at the measure level, and cannot be per-point identity statements.

## 11. Final assessment of the research program

Empirically validated and ready to formalize:
1. `|EGŴ − EGW| = O(N^{-1/2})` with instance-independent constant (Exp A).
2. Stability: linear response of γ* and of the barycentric map, with small ε-robust constants (Exp B/D).
3. The error-bound law with **two explicitly named conditions**: (i) target class-coherence (self-kNN ceiling), (ii) instance conditioning (Exp E/L/I).
4. Spectral pre-screen with AUC ≈ 1 for gross misalignment, N-normalized statistic (Exp K).
5. Fragmentation repair dichotomy: ordinal-preserving artifacts are de-offset repairable; ordinal-destroying artifacts require anchors (Exp G2/J).

Refuted components of the original program: ε-rescue of fragmentation (RQ1), fine-grained spectral predictivity (RQ2's strong form), 1/ε Lipschitz constants, the ε^−1/2 concentration factor, debiased-EGW as a sharper predictor, SNR/density collapse laws, and per-point zero-shot error bounds.
